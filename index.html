     <h2>Happy little....</h2>
     
      <h3>Clouds</h3>
        <p>Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. You can create anything that makes you happy. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.</p>

      <h3>Stream</h3>
        <p>I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.</p>
