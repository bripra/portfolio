     <h2>Happy little....</h2>
     <p>
       Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Get tough with it, get strong. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.

      <h3>Clouds</h3>
        <p>Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. You can create anything that makes you happy. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.</p>

      <h3>Practice</h3>
        <p>Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. You're meant to have fun in life.</p>
