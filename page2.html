      <p>Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. I'm going to mix up a little color. We'll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there.

        A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.

      <h3>Defeating the Weeping Angels</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Forcing two Angels to look directly at each other, which would cause them both to constantly see and quantum-lock each other.</li>
        <li>They were capable of starving to death if left without time energy for too long.</li>
        <li>Cause a paradox which will poison the time energy they use to feed.</li>
      </ul>
