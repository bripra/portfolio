     <h2>Weeping Angels. Whatever you do don't blink...</h2>

      <p>The Weeping Angels were an extremely powerful species of quantum-locked humanoids (sufficient observation changes the thing being observed), so called because their unique nature necessitated that they often covered their faces with their hands to prevent trapping each other in petrified form for eternity by looking at one another. This gave the Weeping Angels their distinct "weeping" appearance. They were known for being "kind" murderous psychopaths, eradicating their victims "mercifully" by dropping them into the past and letting them live out their full lives, just in a different time period. This, in turn, allowed them to live off the remaining time energy of the victim's life. However, when this potential energy paled in comparison to an alternative power source to feed on, the Angels were known to kill by other means, such as snapping their victims' necks.

      <h3>Defeating the Weeping Angels</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Forcing two Angels to look directly at each other, which would cause them both to constantly see and quantum-lock each other.</li>
        <li>They were capable of starving to death if left without time energy for too long.</li>
        <li>Cause a paradox which will poison the time energy they use to feed.</li>
